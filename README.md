# Introduction [![Say Thanks!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-!-1EAEDB.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/sidhuparas1234%40gmail.com)

Ticking Timer is an Android library to implement a visual timer quickly, easily and effortlessly. It's developed to be Kotlin-first and you can implement the features in a very small amount of code.

# Integration

1. In the project-level `build.gradle`:

```
allprojects {
   repositories {
      ...
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

2. In app-level `build.gradle`: [![](https://jitpack.io/v/sidhuparas/TickingTimer.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#sidhuparas/TickingTimer)

```
dependencies {
     implementation 'com.github.sidhuparas:TickingTimer:<latest-version>'
}
```

# How To Use?

1. Add the timer in XML and specify width and height. TickingTimer currently doesn't support feature-specific XML attributes.

```
<com.parassidhu.tickingtimer.TickingTimer
        android:id="@+id/timerView"
        android:layout_width="250dp"
        android:layout_height="250dp" />
```

2. Start the timer in Java/Kotlin code:

```
    timerView.start() // Without any customization
```
or
```
    timerView.start {
        textSize(20)
        shape(Shape.CIRCLE)
        backgroundTint(Color.parseColor(Color.BLACK))
    }
```
# Customizations

| Function | Parameter(s) | Description |
| ------ | ------- |------ |
| timerDuration() | duration (Int) | Duration for which timer should run
| backgroundTint() | color (Int?) | Colored tint for the background. If null is passed, tint is removed
| customBackground() | resource (@DrawableRes res: Int)  | Custom background for the background provided as a drawable
| shape() | shape (Shape) | Set background shape from predefined: CIRCLE, ROUNDED and CIRCLE. Doesn't apply if customBackground is applied after calling this function
| textSize() | size (Int) | Timer duration text size in sp (scaled-pixels)
| textColor() | color (Int) | Timer duration text color
| textAppearance() | resId (Int) | Use for custom styling of the text. Pass the style resource Id
| onFinished() | lambda () | Lambda callback executed when timer finishes
| onTick() | lambda (Int) | Lambda executed on every second elapsed and provides remaining time
| timerAnimation() | animation (Animation) | Custom timer animation
| timerEndAnimation() | lambda (View) | Lambda exposes View and is executed on timer end. Perform end animation on the view here
| applyConfig() | config (Config?) | Pass a config object to apply above properties in one go|
| cancel() | N/A | Cancels the timer. Automatically gets called on onDestroy() of the activity/fragment

# Saving Properties

To save the properties of the timer to reuse, you can use a Config object. Create config like this:

```
   val config = TickingTimer.defaultConfig().apply {
        timerDuration = 10
        textSize = 50
        textColor = Color.BLACK
        shape = Shape.ROUNDED
        customBackground = R.drawable.bg_grad_blue
   }
```

and then apply to the timer while starting:

`timerView.start(config)`

Another way to use the config is to use `applyConfig()` function:

```
   timerView.start {
        applyConfig(config)
        shape(Shape.CIRCLE)
        timerAnimation(ScaleAnimation(this@MainActivity, null))
        customBackground(R.drawable.bg_grad_orange)
   }
```

Remember that the properties defined after `applyConfig()` overrides the config's properties for the specific timer.
